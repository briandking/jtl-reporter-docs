You have to create a new project and scenario before you can upload any performance test data. To a create new project click on the user icon at the top menu, then **administrate** â€”> **add project**. Enter the project name and confirm.

Once you are in the scenario detail you click the **Add test run** button, where you can upload a `.jtl` (CSV) file and fill in other related information. Once you hit **Submit** button you should get confirmation. After the file is processed you will see the new report in the listing.
